## Program Specification 
  
Pete the Potato is a bot developed in Python and created using the Discord Developer Portal for fun potato facts in discord servers! He is hosted using GitHub and Herokuâ€“a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Pete uses a text file to store all his knowledge on potatoes and parses the file to store each fact in a dictionary. Using this dictionary, Pete randomly selects a fact and sends it as a discord message to the user.

## Sample Invocation
The prefix *!* is how Pete knows he is being called. Use the prefix *!* in your discord server to get his attention!
  
### !help
By using the prefix *!* with the command *help* (example: *!help*), Pete will remind you how to call him and how to use his commands. The result should look like:

```
No Category:
  help Shows this message
  pete responds with a cool fact about potatoes!

Type !help command for more info on a command.
You can also type !help category for more info on a category.
```
  
As of right now, Pete's only command other than *!help* is *!pete* which is specified below!
  
### !pete
In your discord server, message Pete by using the prefix *!* with the command *pete* (example: *!pete*) to prompt Pete for a random fact about potatoes! See sample invocation below:
